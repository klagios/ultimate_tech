    "1. Currently with drivers only picking up in one city, there is not any diversity in the pick up cities of each driver. In order to gauge whether the toll reimbursement helps increase diversity of pick up cities, the metric that could be used as a key measure of success would be the Shannon Equitability Index that returns a value from 0 to 1 measuring how diverse a sample is. 0 means there is no diversity in the samples, and 1 means each unique value is equally represented. This metric could be performed on the city of pick up for each driver. \n",

    "2. This experiment could be set up as a null hypothesis test. \n",

    "a. Data would need to be collected on the pick up cities for drivers during the weekends, for a sufficient amount of time/quantity of samples. New data would then have to be collected after the reimbursement program went into effect and the results would have to be compared statistically. Only weekends should be included because due to the circadian rhythms of the two cities, demand is higher in Metropolis during the day and Gotham at night, so it makes sense that drivers exclusively pick up in those cities during those times. \n",
    "\n",
    "b. The statistical test that would be used is calculating the z-statistic and the p-value. Let's say that the mean Shannon Equitability Index for current conditions was 0.27. The H0 is p=0.27 and the HA would be p>0.27. \n",
    "\n",
    "c. If the p-value is lower than, say 0.05, then the null hypothesis would be rejected and the conclusion would be that the reimbursement program increased diversity of the pick ups. If p>=0.05, the null hypothesis would not be rejected, and it would reveal that the reimbursement program had no effect. \n",
